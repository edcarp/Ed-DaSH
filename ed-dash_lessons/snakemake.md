# Bioinformatics workflows with Snakemake

## Contributors
Tim Booth, Nathan Medd, Hywel Dunn-Davies, Katie Emelianova, Frances Turner.

## Overview
Overall goals
* To understand the core principles of Snakemake and what it's useful for
* To learn the syntax and features of the Snakemake language
* To design, implement, optimise and debug Snakemake workflows
* To be confident applying Snakemake to real-world analysis tasks  

This lesson is designed to be covered over two days plus an extra session for a longer challenge.

## Content
* Running commands with Snakemake	
  * How do I run a simple command with Snakemake?
* Placeholders and Wildcards
  * How do I make a generic rule?
* Chaining rules
  * How do I combine rules into a workflow?
  * How do I make a rule with multiple inputs and outputs?
* Partial and remedial runs
  * How do I visualise a Snakemake workflow?
  * How does Snakemake avoid unecessary work?
  * How do I control what steps will be run?
* Processing lists of inputs
  * How do I process multiple files at once?
  * How do I add splitting and combining steps?
  * How do I make Snakemake auto-detect inputs?
* Quoting and error checking
  * How do I make my Snakefiles robust?
* Configuring workflows
  * How do separate my rules from my configuration?
  * How do I make my workflows re-usable?
* Speeding up workflows
  * How does Snakemake handle parallel execution and threads?
  * How can I make my workflow as fast as possible?
* Conda integration
  * How do I use conda packages in conjunction with Snakemake

## Longer challenge
We ask the participants to re-implement an existing workflow, provided as a shell script, as a Snakemake workflow.  
This is supposed to be an extra day after the two days course, with an example based upon ChIP-Seq analysis.
