# Introduction to Bioinformatics workflows with Nextflow and nf-core

## Overview
Nextflow is  a workflow management system, similar to Snakemake but written in Groovy.  
[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) is community-led repository of high quality bioinformatics workflows using Nextflow.  
This Nextflow course is based on https://seqera.io/training/.  
nf-core content of lesson: https://nf-co.re/usage/tutorials/nf_core_tutorial.  
Same [dataset](https://github.com/ggrimes/nextflow_rnaseq_training_dataset) as the [Ed-DaSH Snakemake lesson](/ed-dash_lessons/snakemake.md).  
The lesson is designed to be covered over two days.
