# Introduction to Conda for Data Scientists

## Overview
[Conda](https://conda.io/) is package and environment management tools. This lesson is an introduction to Conda for (data) scientists. Conda is an open source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between environments on your local computer. While Conda was created for Python programs it can package and distribute software for any languages such as R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, FORTRAN. This lesson motivates the use of Conda as a development tool for building and sharing project specific software environments that facilitate reproducible (data) science workflows.  
This lesson is based on the [existing Conda lesson on the Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists), with rewriten examples and some content for a Bioinformatics audience.  
This lesson is designed for being covered in haf a day.
