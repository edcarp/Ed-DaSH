# Overview
A 2-day workshop on statistical methods for high-dimensional datasets. Covering “modern” methods but not “basic stats” or “machine learning”. 
Also not a programming course..

## Prerequisites
Basic R programming (eg, data/software carpentries).  
Basic stats (eg, linear models course).  

## Learning goals
Based on a survey of the target audience, we narrowed down on a set of goals (and thus lessons): 
* Go beyond classical tests
* Understand and apply statistical methods for high-dimensional data
* Understand and appraise/compare methods

## Content
Intro (1/4 day)
* Notation
* Some assumptions (briefly), e.g. linear models assumptions
* Perhaps some techniques (e.g. cross-validation)

High-dimensional regression
* Fitting many linear modules
  * Multiple testing
  * Information sharing between features
* glmnet: lasso/ridge/elastic net
  * cross-validation, selecting variables

Dimensionality reduction
