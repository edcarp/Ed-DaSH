subtitle: Edinburgh - Data Science Training in Health & Bioscience
---  

# Overview

Our aim is to enable researchers at all career stages to harness the power of data-driven research and innovation for health and bioscience, by providing training in the management and analysis of biological data. We will address this aim by scaling up our successful and oversubscribed training programs, by engaging with The Carpentriesâ€™ open platform, adding new curricula, and training new instructors. Our remotely delivered training programme will
be piloted locally and made available nationally, publicized via our strong links to organizations involved in data science UK-wide.

# Objectives

1. To develop peer-reviewed training modules for biological data science that address identified skill gaps in health and bioscience researchers (Statistics; Open science, [FAIR principles][fair]{:target="_blank"} [_Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable_] & Data Management; Data Science computing with workflows) using [The Carpentries][carpentries]{:target="_blank"} platform.
2. To deliver 98 days of remote training of our new workshops, plus established introductory material, to a diverse community of researchers in academia and industry across all career stages.
3. To offer a clinic after every workshop for learners to ask advice regarding their own projects.
4. To train 30 new instructors to deliver these workshops, building a scalable training community.

# Training Curriculum

* Computational workflows
  * Unix, Conda, Nextflow/Snakemake (4 days)
* Open science, FAIR principles, and data management
  * FAIR in practice (2 days)
  * FAIR for leaders (1 day)
* Statistics
  * Basic and intermediate statistical skills<sup>1</sup> (2 days)
  * High dimensional statistics (2 days)
  * Machine learning<sup>1</sup> (2 days)

<sup>1</sup>Developed by teams funded by the [Software Sustainability Institute][ssi]{:target="_blank"}
